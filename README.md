# Image Captioning using VGG16 and LSTM

## Description
This project implements an image captioning model that generates descriptive captions for images using a combination of VGG16 and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model uses the pre-trained VGG16 network for feature extraction from images and employs an LSTM for sequence modeling to generate human-readable captions.

The dataset used in this project is the Mini COCO 2014 dataset, which contains 18.7K images with 5 captions per image. The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model that can automatically generate captions for images, which is useful in applications such as accessibility tools, automated content generation, and image search.

## Dataset
- **Name**: Mini COCO 2014 dataset
- **Size**: 18.7K images with 5 captions per image
- **Source**: [Mini COCO 2014 dataset for image captioning on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nagasai524/mini-coco2014-dataset-for-image-captioning)

The dataset contains a diverse collection of everyday images annotated with captions describing the content.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Handling Large Dataset**  
  - **Problem**: The Mini COCO 2014 dataset is large, making it computationally expensive to process and train the model.  
  - **Solution**: Used data preprocessing techniques such as resizing images and extracting features in advance using the VGG16 model, reducing the computational load during training.

- **Generating Accurate Captions**  
  - **Problem**: Ensuring the LSTM model generates relevant and accurate captions for the images.  
  - **Solution**: Fine-tuned the LSTM network using the extracted features from VGG16, along with carefully preprocessed captions, improving the quality of the generated captions.

- **Managing Image and Text Data Integration**  
  - **Problem**: Efficiently integrating image features with corresponding captions for training the model.  
  - **Solution**: Implemented a custom data generator to load image features and captions in parallel, ensuring synchronized processing during model training.

- **Training Convergence and Overfitting**  
  - **Problem**: The model was slow to converge, and there were signs of overfitting due to the relatively small dataset.  
  - **Solution**: Applied techniques like dropout in the LSTM layers and early stopping to prevent overfitting and speed up training convergence.

## Tools and Technologies

- **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training the deep learning model. It provides powerful tools for both image processing and sequence modeling.
- **Keras**: A high-level API for building and training neural networks, used alongside TensorFlow for easier model construction and experimentation.
- **VGG16**: A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network used for extracting features from images.
- **LSTM**: A type of Recurrent Neural Network used for generating sequences, particularly useful for generating captions.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and handling large data arrays, crucial for processing the image and text data.
- **Pandas**: Used for managing the dataset, especially for handling and organizing the captions.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for visualizing model training progress and generating graphical outputs.
- **NLTK**: Used for text preprocessing, including tokenization and handling of caption data.
